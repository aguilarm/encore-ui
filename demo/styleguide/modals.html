<rx-page title="'Encore-UI - Modals'">

Question: do we re-do rxForm or create a new component specifically for this? Or should we just clone it?
Address notifications (static)
We should document patterns of how modals are titled and what button text is (see LBaaS for examples--there are some inconsistencies here Encore-wide)
When do we use modals versus requiring a whole new page?  What is the threshold for what we want to do in a modal?
Strategy for communicating errors / validation messages from the server - should their be direction on how we do this?
On the technical side, should we have  default strategy for handling standard http status codes:  IE: 403 Forbidden - User does not have access to resource
