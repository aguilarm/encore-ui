<rx-page title="'Encore-UI - Modals'">

<h3 class="title clear">Basic Usage</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Basic usage of the rxModalAction angular.js component. Using rxModalForm which will automatically comes with a title, subtitle, submit and cancel text.</li>
    <li>Address notifications (static)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="title lg">Design Patterns within Encore</h2>

<ul>
    <li>All this comes with design patterns we already use for the rest of Encore so you don't have to worry about design, but if you need to deviate from that at all, you'll need to take a look at how the rxModalForm directive was built and build upon that.</li>
    <li>When do we use modals versus requiring a whole new page?  What is the threshold for what we want to do in a modal?</li>
    <li>Strategy for communicating errors / validation messages from the server - should there be direction on how we do this?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="title lg">UI Roadmap / Possible Future-work</h2>

<ul>
    <li>We should document patterns of how modals are titled and what button text is (see LBaaS for examples--there are some inconsistencies here Encore-wide)</li>
</ul>
